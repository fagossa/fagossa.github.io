# Cats-effect
The goal of this article is to document some _cats-effect_ techniques that could be helpful to start working with effets.


## Defining our domain model
The goal of this application is to request the temperature for a city, keep the history of request and show the hottest city.
```scala
object domain {

  // the location of an imaginary external forecast service
  case class ForecastConfig(host: String, port: Int)


  sealed trait TempUnit extends Product with Serializable
  case object Celcius extends TempUnit

  case class Temperature(value: Int, unit: TempUnit = Celcius)

  case class City(name: String)

  case class Forecast(temperature: Temperature)

  // Our business errors
  sealed trait AppErrors extends NoStackTrace with Product with Serializable
  case class UnknownCity(name: String) extends AppErrors

}
```

## Writing to the console
As we are going to develop a console application we are going to need a way to
wrap thoses interactions with an effect. The simplest behavior is going to be
_reading_ and _writing_ from the terminal:

```scala
trait Console[F[_]] {
  def printLn(line: String): F[Unit]
  def readLn: F[String]
}
```
Notice, that with that _trait_ we are forced to ask for the _implicit_
instance of _console_ every single time we need to used one: `implicitly[Console[F]].printLn("hello")`.
A simple trick could be to hide that in a companion object:
```scala
object Console {
  def apply[F[_]: Console]: Console[F] = implicitly[Console[F]]
}
```
So, now every time we need to write to the console, we just do:
`Console[F]].printLn("hello")`.

Anoter alternative could using [console4cats](https://github.com/profunktor/console4cats) that already implement this for us.

## Business logic

### The weather client
The default implementation of our client has just some hardcoded values.
As our _trait_ has only one method, me can easilly transform our implementation into an _Single Abstract Method_ (SAM).
```scala
trait WeatherClient[F[_]]{
  def forecast(city: City): F[Forecast]
}
object WeatherClient {
  def make[F[_]: Sync](host: String, port: Int): F[WeatherClient[F]] = Sync[F].pure {
    case City("Paris") => Sync[F].pure(Forecast(Temperature(28)))
    case City("Lyon") => Sync[F].pure(Forecast(Temperature(34)))
    case _ => Sync[F].pure(Forecast(Temperature(15)))
  }
}
```
In order to build our client, we need to extract certains values from the configuration. We could do this using the MTL approach with a `ApplicativeAsk` but we could be (severily) penalised in perf. A much simpler approach is to just specify the config as a parameter and then extracting the data as effects (maybe doing some validations).

```scala

def host[F[_]: Sync](config: ForecastConfig): F[String] = Sync[F].pure(config.host)

def port[F[_]: Sync](config: ForecastConfig): F[Int] = Sync[F].pure(config.port)

```

### Handling state
The history of request is stored in a [Ref](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/concurrency/ref.html). A `Ref` is basically a _thread safe_ container.
```scala
type Requests = Map[City, Forecast]
import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
def hottestCity[F[_]: Functor](ref: Ref[F, Requests]): F[Option[(City, Temperature)]] = {
  import cats.syntax.functor._
  ref.get.map(
    reqs =>
      reqs.toList
        .sortBy(_._2.temperature.value)
        .map {
          case (city, forcast) => (city, forcast.temperature)
        }
        .reverse
        .headOption)
}
```

### Some utilitary functions
Just for information here are a couple of utilitary functions used
```scala
def askCity[F[_]: Console: Monad]: F[String] = {
  import cats.syntax.functor._, cats.syntax.flatMap._
  for {
    _        <- Console[F].printLn("What is your next city?")
    cityName <- Console[F].readLn
  } yield cityName
}

def cityByName[F[_]: Sync](name: String): F[City] = {
  import cats.syntax.applicative._
  name match {
    case "Paris" | "Lyon" => City(name).pure[F]
    case _ => Sync[F].raiseError(UnknownCity(name))
  }
}
```

## Our application loop
The main loop consist of asking for a new city, verifying the state and determine if is the hotter
```scala
import cats.effect.concurrent.Ref
def askLoop[F[_]: Sync: Console](
  weatherClient: WeatherClient,
  ref: Ref[F, Requests]
): F[Unit] = {
  import cats.syntax.functor._, cats.syntax.flatMap._
  for {
    _         <- Console[F].printLn(s"Start")
    cityName  <- askCity[F]
    city      <- cityByName[F](cityName)
    forecast  <- weatherClient.forecast[F](city)
    _         <- Console[F].printLn(s"Forecast for $city is ${forecast.temperature}")
    _         <- ref.update(current => current + (city -> forecast))
    maybeCity <- hottestCity[F](ref)
    _ <- maybeCity match {
      case Some((city, temperature)) => Console[F].printLn(s"Hottest city found so far is $temperature in $city")
      case None => Console[F].printLn(s"No city yet")
    }
  } yield ()
}
```

### Composing everything
Our program is basically building the weather client, creating an initial state
and repeating the main loop forever.
```scala
def program[F[_]: Console: Sync](
  config: ForecastConfig
): F[Unit] = {
  import cats.syntax.functor._, cats.syntax.flatMap._
  for {
    h      <- host[F](config)
    p      <- port[F](config)
    client <- WeatherClient.make(h, p)
    _      <- Console[F].printLn(s"Using weather service at http://$h:$p \n")
    state  <- Ref.of[F, Map[City, Forecast]](Map.empty[City, Forecast])
    _      <- askLoop[F](client, state).foreverM[Unit]
  } yield ()
}
```

### Running our application
Finally, running our application is just calling the program and provide an
instance of _Console_ for _IO_.
```scala
object ForecastApp extends IOApp {
  implicit val ioConsole: Console[IO] = new Console[IO] {
    override def printLn(line: String): IO[Unit] = IO.delay(println(line))
    override def readLn: IO[String] = IO.delay(scala.io.StdIn.readLine())
  }

  override def run(args: List[String]): IO[ExitCode] = {
    for {
      config <- IO.pure(domain.ForecastConfig("localhost", 8080))
      _      <- Logic.program[IO](config)
    } yield ExitCode.Success
  }
}
```
